This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using Python.

# How to Play
The game is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball. The objective is to score more points than your opponent by making the ball pass through their side.

Player 1 controls the left paddle using the W and S keys.
Player 2 controls the right paddle using the Up and Down arrow keys.
The game ends when one player reaches the score limit (default is set to 5, but can be modified).

# Requirements
Python 3.x
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the game:
